\chapter*{Abstract}
This report will be discussing how we designed and implemented a robot that mimics Braitenberg behaviors, more specifically love, aggression, fear and curiosity. We will discuss the robot that was used and its specs and configurations alongside the way we implement it followed with testing and its results. The main focus of the report will be how we used the robot to mimic certain actions and behaviors. This report will also include how we made the robot track a specific object/human and how implemented a following/tracking action.
